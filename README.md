This is a program used to run an amusement park. Users can create an account and can log into the program. Users can buy a ticket for a ride with certain conditions such as age or height, and the ticket can also be refunded. Users can use their tickets to play a ride, then the user can provide criticism and suggestions for the rides being played. Users can top up their account balances and also upgrade their accounts to golden accounts.

In this program there is also a side that can only be accessed by the admin. Admin can add new rides, view the history of using a ride, see the best rides based on the number of tickets sold, and see criticism and suggestions given by the user.
